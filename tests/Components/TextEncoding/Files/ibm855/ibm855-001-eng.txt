{69426}{69471}that you wrote|your name on.
{69474}{69548}I'd never get over that,|I tell you that.
{69551}{69621}I know about|the picture in Reno.
{69623}{69660}Hey, Molly!
{69663}{69742}Ask her about the sweater|she knitted in the closet
{69746}{69781}that's too big.
{69783}{69887}He asked me to remind you|of the sweater in the closet
{69890}{69933}that you knitted|that's too big.
{69935}{69986}Four sizes.
{70023}{70078}Hey, you hear me|talking to you?
{70082}{70117}I hear you.
{70119}{70160}Shut up. Nobody's|talking to you.
{70163}{70194}Ever hear of a phone?
{70197}{70238}Want to kiss my butt?
{70241}{70297}I'm not staying|down here all day.
{70299}{70321}Thank God.
{70323}{70358}Aw, man, shut up.
{70361}{70417}Molly! I'm going|to count to 3,
{70419}{70475}and I'm out of here.
{70477}{70507}1 , 2, 3.
{70555}{70591}No, Oda, wait.
{70593}{70615}No.
{70617}{70647}It's Molly.
{70807}{70843}Molly?
{70907}{70964}I'm Oda Mae Brown.
{71063}{71106}I don't know you or Sam,
{71109}{71169}but let me tell you|what he did.
{71171}{71217}He kept me up all night
{71219}{71257}singing I'm Henry|The Eighth, I Am.
{71259}{71347}That's how he got me|to go out with him.
{71350}{71378}Look, I'm sorry.
{71386}{71431}I just--|I just don't believe
{71434}{71508}in this life|after death stuff.
{71510}{71542}Well, tell her|she's wrong.
{71544}{71605}He says|you're wrong.
{71607}{71653}You're talking to him|right now?
{71655}{71732}He just asked me to tell you|that you're wrong.
{71735}{71770}So where is he?
{71773}{71854}I can't see him.|I can only hear him.
{71856}{71914}I'm right here.
{71918}{71970}That doesn't help,|Sam.
{71972}{72045}I'm holding|her hand.
{72047}{72098}He says he's|holding your hand.
{72339}{72370}What are you doing?
{72377}{72466}What do you think|you're doing to me?
{72469}{72547}If you think I'm here for|my health, you're crazy.
{72551}{72619}Sam's dead, OK?|He's dead.
{72622}{72667}Tell her|I love her.
{72670}{72716}He says|he loves you.
{72755}{72814}Sam would|never say that.
{72816}{72838}Say ditto.
{72840}{72876}What the hell|is ditto?
{72879}{72906}Ditto!
{73607}{73649}To tell you|the truth,
{73651}{73706}I don't know how|I'm doing this.
{73713}{73745}Confidentially,|nothing like this
{73747}{73793}has ever happened|to me before.
{73795}{73827}I mean, nothing.
{73834}{73875}Now I can't|turn it off.
{73932}{73981}Is this him?|Is this you?
{73984}{74006}- Yeah.|- Yeah.
{74008}{74050}Huh. Cute.
{74053}{74089}White,|but cute.
{74093}{74151}What I don't|understand is,
{74154}{74194}why did he come back?
{74198}{74230}I don't know.
{74231}{74266}Why is he|still here?
{74270}{74315}He's stuck,|that's what it is.
{74318}{74350}He's in between|worlds.
{74351}{74388}You know,|it happens sometimes
{74391}{74446}that the spirit gets|yanked out so quick
{74448}{74484}that the essence|still feels
{74487}{74518}it has work to do.
{74520}{74554}Would you stop rambling?
{74557}{74588}I'm just answering|her question.
{74591}{74626}He's got|an attitude now.
{74629}{74677}I don't have an attitude.
{74680}{74726}Yes, you do|have an attitude.
{74728}{74758}We're having|a little discussion.
{74761}{74804}If you didn't have|a attitude,
{74807}{74849}you wouldn't have|raised your voice.
{74851}{74887}God damn it,|Oda Mae--
{74891}{74921}Don't you god damn me.
{74924}{74977}Don't you take|the Lord's name in vain.
{74979}{75012}Would you relax?
{75015}{75060}You relax.|You're the dead guy.
{75063}{75108}Want me to help?|You apologize.
{75111}{75132}Jesus Christ!
{75135}{75160}I'm leaving.
{75163}{75218}Nobody talks to me like that,|you understand?
{75219}{75255}Now, you better|apologize.
{75258}{75290}I'm sorry.
{75291}{75314}I apologize.
{75315}{75353}OK?
{75355}{75422}Now, would you|sit down?
{75424}{75446}Please?
{75448}{75499}He's apologized.
{75528}{75598}I need you to tell|Molly what I'm saying,
{75600}{75670}but you have to tell her|word for word.
{75673}{75756}Yes. He wants me to tell you|what he's saying
{75759}{75809}word for word.
{75928}{75959}Molly, you're in danger.
{75962}{76031}You can't just|blurt it out like that.
{76034}{76074}And quit moving around,|will you?
{76077}{76113}You're making me dizzy.
{76115}{76173}I'll just tell her|in my own way.
{76176}{76260}Molly, you in danger,|girl.
{76263}{76309}What are you|talking about?
{76311}{76361}I know the man|who killed me.
{76363}{76400}He knows|who killed him.
{76403}{76464}His name's Willy Lopez.|I know where he lives.
{76467}{76513}He's a Puerto Rican,|Willy Lopez.
{76515}{76550}He knows|where he lives.
{76551}{76574}Write it down.
{76575}{76607}You write it down.
{76610}{76645}I ain't no|damn secretary.
{76647}{76670}Just do it!
{76672}{76704}Argh!
{76707}{76765}He's so testy.
{76767}{76838}What is it you|want me to write?
{76840}{76907}It's 303 Prospect Place,|apartment 4-D.
{76910}{76942}303 Prospect Place?
{76943}{76966}Yeah.
{76968}{77017}That's my|neighborhood.
{77019}{77066}Molly, he's got|my wallet,
{77067}{77103}he's got my key,
{77106}{77138}and he was|in here.
{77139}{77220}He's got his wallet|and key and was here.
{77223}{77268}Yesterday after your|walk with Carl,
{77271}{77326}you talked to Floyd,|took off your clothes--
{77329}{77364}All right,|all right.
{77367}{77420}When you came in|after your walk with Carl,
{77423}{77469}he saw|everything.
{77471}{77530}Go to the police.|It was a setup.
{77533}{77579}I was murdered.
{77582}{77653}He says go to the police.|He was murdered.
{77655}{77685}There's somebody|else involved--
{77687}{77754}I don't want no more|to do with this.
{77757}{77793}Where are you going?
{77795}{77866}I'm leaving, I did everything|I said I'd do.
{77867}{77917}And don't be|following me.
{77919}{77965}I'm finished.|I mean it.
{77967}{78022}Have a nice life.|Have a nice death.
{78025}{78049}Goodbye.
{78114}{78170}Molly, there is no one|on earth besides you
{78177}{78252}who wants this|to be true more than me,
{78255}{78309}but you got to be|rational about this.
{78311}{78385}Sam is no more|in this room than--
{78387}{78521}Look, I understand the|need to hang on to him,
{78524}{78595}I really do,|but this is absurd.
{78598}{78693}I know this seems absurd,|but it had to be real.
{78696}{78742}You believed some|fortune-teller from Brooklyn
{78744}{78792}who shows up|at your door?
{78795}{78864}I watched her have|a conversation with him.
{78867}{78921}I don't buy it, Moll,|not for a minute.
{78924}{78976}What about the things|she knew?
{78979}{79017}What things?
{79020}{79106}The photo Sam took of me|on our trip to Reno.
{79113}{79151}Carl, we were alone.
{79154}{79237}And the green underwear|that I wrote my name in.
{79314}{79375}She said Sam knew|who killed him.
{79379}{79457}Yeah, that he|was set up.
{79458}{79506}This is getting|deranged.
{79507}{79543}We're off|the deep end.
{79546}{79598}She had a name|and an address--
{79599}{79622}Willy Lopez.
{79623}{79679}303 Prospect Place,|apartment 4-D.
{79716}{79748}This is sick.
{79751}{79786}Oh, Carl.
{79790}{79836}This is really sick.
{79863}{79886}Oh, God.
{79889}{79921}Molly, I don't|understand
{79923}{79969}how you could--|you could...
{80033}{80078}swallow this crap.|I mean...
{80081}{80137}this guy|may not even exist.
{80139}{80210}Maybe she's just|trying to use you
{80212}{80273}to set someone up.
{80277}{80324}You're right.
{80327}{80362}You're absolutely right.
{80365}{80434}That's what|I got to find out.
{80437}{80493}What do you mean,|find out?
{80496}{80569}She said Sam wants me|to go to the police.
{80577}{80633}Sam wants you to|go to the police?
{80635}{80702}Jesus, Moll. Are you|out of your mind?
{80703}{80759}What are you going|to tell the police?
{80762}{80797}That some|storefront psychic
{80799}{80855}has been communing|with the dead?
{80858}{80917}Do you know what|that sounds like?
{80919}{80975}You're talking ghosts here,|for Christ's sake.
{81018}{81040}I'm sorry.
{81042}{81109}This stuff just really|gets to me,
{81111}{81133}you know?
{81135}{81190}It's OK if you|don't believe me.
{81193}{81229}I'm trying to, Molly.
{81315}{81353}Look...
{81356}{81426}if it'll make you|feel any better,
{81428}{81527}I'll go check|this out, OK?
{81530}{81599}I want you to try|and get some sleep.
{81602}{81623}OK?

{82972}{83030}''Talking to''?|What the hell do you mean?

{83088}{83134}Where's she|getting it from?
{83136}{83196}I haven't said|a word to anybody.

{84160}{84204}What the hell|is wrong with you?
{84207}{84263}Is everything a joke?
{84267}{84306}You killed a man.

{84337}{84395}-Was that a joke?|-I did you a favor.
{84398}{84430}That was a freebie.

{86245}{86331}You think I'd come down here|if it wasn't real?
{86365}{86379}You know,
{86390}{86469}you told me if I had|any new information
{86471}{86507}that I should come.
{86509}{86541}So here I am.
{86641}{86687}I know|how this sounds.
{86689}{86735}I hear myself|saying it,
{86737}{86783}and I want|to cringe.
{86785}{86856}But this woman knew things|she couldn't have known.
{86858}{86917}Things Sam|only said to me.
{86921}{86993}OK, according to this|psychic lady,
{86996}{87100}there are ghosts and spirits|all over the place

{87807}{87839}OK. Wait here.
{87841}{87930}Let me see if the guy's|got a record, all right?
{87933}{87974}Great.
{89473}{89510}What are you doing?
{89513}{89561}Where's the file|on Willy Lopez?
{89564}{89600}There isn't one.

{96476}{96546}You needed me to hear you,|and I didn't.
{96549}{96618}I wasn't there for you,|and that was...
{96621}{96660}that was wrong.
{96663}{96694}It's just, I...
{96734}{96766}I just--
{96768}{96839}I want you to know|that I'm your friend.
{96841}{96877}Thanks, Carl.
{96880}{96924}You were never|our friend.
{96926}{96982}That really means|a lot to me.
{96985}{97048}Me, too. I brought you|some Japanese apple pears.
{97051}{97087}I know you like them.
{97129}{97150}Thanks.
{97153}{97188}That's very sweet.
{97191}{97243}Could I come in|for a second?
{97246}{97304}It's just been|one of those days.
{97306}{97334}Maybe some coffee?
{97338}{97366}Yeah. Come on in.
{97370}{97409}No, Molly.
{97412}{97458}You seem a little tense.
{97460}{97496}Are you OK?
{97498}{97530}No. I'm fine.
{97533}{97602}It's just--|What can I tell you?
{97605}{97641}It's been tough.
{97642}{97696}It just still hurts|so much.
{97698}{97730}You lying snake.
{97732}{97801}And on top of it,|it's stuff at work.
{97807}{97857}They've given me|my own accounts,
{97860}{97891}which is good,
{97894}{97977}but I just haven't really|had time to adjust,
{97980}{98023}kind of absorb|everything.
{98126}{98156}It's no big deal.
{98228}{98250}Yeah.
{98402}{98473}Can I have just|a little more cream?
{98498}{98527}Yeah.
{98561}{98586}Oh, shit.
{98590}{98649}Jesus. I can't believe|I did that.
{98651}{98680}Are you all right?
{98682}{98729}Yeah, I'm fine.
{98730}{98752}Oh, God.
{98754}{98809}Let me throw that|in the washer.
{98811}{98878}Don't worry about it.|It's OK. It's just...
{98882}{98917}You want|another shirt?
{98919}{98978}No. It'll dry.|It'll just take a minute.
{98980}{99015}There you go.
{99093}{99123}Where were you today?
{99130}{99202}I thought you were going|to come into the bank
{99205}{99237}and sign those papers?
{99239}{99303}I was supposed to,|but I didn't have time.
{99306}{99377}I went to the police.
{99530}{99553}You did?
{99561}{99606}Wow. What|did you tell them?
{99609}{99640}What did they say?
{99642}{99678}It was awful.
{99710}{99755}I felt really stupid.
{99758}{99837}They brought out a file|on this woman and--
{99838}{99885}At least|1 0 inches thick.
{99912}{99950}A ripoff artist, huh?
{99953}{99978}No, Molly.
{100022}{100067}You know,|the sad thing...
{100106}{100153}is that|I believed her.
{100155}{100190}Molly...
{100240}{100289}sometimes|we need to believe.
{100328}{100360}Why? What's the point?
{100362}{100395}Molly, it's not easy to face|the realities of life sometimes.
{100454}{100503}You got to|give yourself that.
{100506}{100619}What you've got to remember|is the love that you guys felt.
{100622}{100678}You got to remember|how good Sam was.
{100679}{100739}You were everything|to him, Molly.
{100742}{100774}You were his life.
{101128}{101160}I feel so alone.
{101369}{101401}You're not alone.
{101403}{101425}OK?
{101458}{101515}You got your work.|You're incredibly talented.
{101518}{101540}You're young.
{101542}{101595}You're fantastically|gorgeous.
{101636}{101692}I don't know|what's real anymore.
{101722}{101782}I don't know|what to think.
{101859}{101900}Just think about Sam.
{101964}{102033}Think about the time|you guys had together.
{102062}{102106}How wonderful that was.
{102136}{102163}Yeah.
{102192}{102262}Let your feelings out,|Moll. It's OK.
{102266}{102324}Life turns on a dime.
{102360}{102384}You know?
{102425}{102449}I mean...
{102476}{102513}people think that...
{102516}{102589}they're there forever, that there's|always going to be tomorrow,
{102592}{102623}but that's bullshit.
{102626}{102673}Sam taught us that.
{102709}{102765}You have to|live for now.
{102828}{102855}For today.
{103337}{103358}I can't.
{103361}{103382}I'm sorry.
{103385}{103406}It's OK.
{103410}{103474}I--I--I can't.|It's just too soon.
{103476}{103498}It's OK.
{103500}{103546}You've been great,|Carl.
{103618}{103665}But I need you|to leave.
{103666}{103698}I understand totally.
{103701}{103722}Please.
{103859}{103936}Could we just have dinner|tomorrow night? Just talk?
{103938}{103994}Can I interest you|in that?
{104027}{104052}Yeah.
{104054}{104076}Sure.
{104078}{104100}Great.
{105738}{105759}Hey.
{105873}{105929}Get off my train!
{105931}{105953}No.
{105955}{105998}Get off!
{105999}{106024}Get off!
{106026}{106046}Get off!
{106047}{106078}Get off!

{106116}{106143}Get out of here!
{106146}{106170}Get off!
{106174}{106195}No.
{106198}{106243}Show me|how you do that.
{106246}{106299}I'm not leaving|till you teach me.
{106306}{106329}Get off!
{106332}{106357}No.
{106359}{106381}Get off!
{106550}{106609}You stubborn asshole.
{106611}{106647}Ha ha ha.
{106650}{106682}What are you doing?
{106683}{106730}What the hell|are you doing?
{106731}{106767}What am I doing?
{106770}{106826}You're trying to move it|with your finger.
{106827}{106883}You can't push it.|You're dead.
{107087}{107134}It's all in your mind.
{107135}{107219}The problem with you|is you still think you're real.
{107222}{107267}You think you're|wearing those clothes?
{107270}{107323}You think you're crouched|on that floor?
{107326}{107347}Bullshit!
{107350}{107409}You ain't got a body|no more, son!
{107412}{107444}It's all up here!
{107446}{107482}You want|to move something,
{107484}{107540}you got to move it|with your mind!
{107542}{107578}You got to focus!
{107580}{107626}How? How do you focus?
{107628}{107686}I don't know|how you focus.
{107689}{107725}You just focus.
{107804}{107846}How did you do that?
{107848}{107902}You got to take|all your emotions,
{107903}{107969}all your anger, all your love,|all your hate,
{107970}{108002}and push it way down
{108009}{108047}into the pit|of your stomach
{108050}{108109}and let it explode|like a reactor. Pow!
{108163}{108186}OK.
{108188}{108210}OK.
{108330}{108368}Don't laugh.
{108961}{108998}Way to go, kid.
{109002}{109034}I did it.
{109076}{109113}I did it.
{109116}{109147}Way to go.
{109315}{109384}From your gut,|like I told you.
{109455}{109526}Give it time.|What else have you got?
{109706}{109765}How long|have you been here?
{109818}{109869}Since they pushed me.
{109873}{109909}Someone pushed you?
{109911}{109941}Yeah, someone pushed me.
{109943}{109977}Who?
{109979}{110010}You don't believe me?
{110013}{110082}You think I fell?|You think I jumped?
{110084}{110119}Well, fuck you!
{110122}{110158}It wasn't my time!
{110162}{110207}I wasn't supposed to go!
{110210}{110269}I'm not supposed|to be here!
{110330}{110370}Oh.
{110403}{110432}Oh.
{110488}{110587}Oh, I'd give anything|for a drag.
{110590}{110642}Just one drag.
{110650}{110687}Are you all right?
{110690}{110753}Who are you?|Why are you hounding me?
{110756}{110803}Who sent you?
{110853}{110896}Who sent you?
{110948}{110985}Leave me alone.
{110988}{111020}Leave me alone!
{111022}{111073}Leave me alone!
{112118}{112142}Yes!
{112510}{112546}You need|to concentrate,
{112548}{112580}'cause if|you concentrate,
{112582}{112618}you'll probably|rouse him.
{112620}{112652}What's his name|again?
{112654}{112676}Orlando.
{112678}{112702}Orlando.
{112705}{112773}Orlando. Orlando.|Is there an Orlando here?
{112775}{112797}I'm here.
{112799}{112821}He's here.
{112823}{112855}Oda Mae, I--
{112858}{112879}Sam.
{112882}{112914}Excuse me.|I'm Orlando.
{112915}{112951}The line's|over there.
{112954}{112999}Where did these ghosts|come from?
{113002}{113034}You can hear them, too?
{113036}{113106}I hear them in the morning|and the evening.
{113108}{113147}They're coming|into the shower.
{113150}{113222}Did you tell every spook|you met about me?
{113224}{113289}I got spooks from Jersey|coming in here.
{113292}{113353}There's stuff going on|you wouldn't believe.
{113356}{113402}It's amazing.|You're really doing it.
{113409}{113427}I know.
{113433}{113473}Can you|hurry this up?
{113475}{113529}Oh, chill out.|Chill out.
{113531}{113563}I need your help.
{113565}{113611}There's something|we need to do.
{113614}{113670}I'm not doing anything|else with you, Sam.
{113673}{113718}You're holding on|to a life
{113721}{113754}that doesn't|want you anymore.
{113756}{113808}It doesn't want you.|Give up the ghost.
{113810}{113857}Are you speaking|to me?
{113858}{113905}Does it look like it?
{113906}{113969}You're supposed to be|concentrating, aren't you?
{113973}{114009}You going to try it?
{114010}{114039}Thank you very much.
{114042}{114098}Sam, are you going|to get out of here?
{114104}{114122}Uh-uh.
{114128}{114160}Fine, then stay there.
{114162}{114184}Excuse me.
{114186}{114208}Excuse me.
{114210}{114241}You ready now?
{114243}{114278}Let's do it.
{114281}{114337}I got to talk|to you now.
{114339}{114374}I've got a plan.
{114377}{114464}All we got to do|is we can...
{114466}{114493}Oda Mae?
{114660}{114690}Oda Mae.
{114755}{114778}Ortisha?
{114812}{114859}Orlando. Is that you?
{114861}{114932}Ortisha, where you at?|I can't hardly see.
{114934}{114955}Here.|Sh-She's here.
{114958}{115040}In front of you.|I'm right here.
{115125}{115203}Damn, baby, what did|you do to your hair?
{115257}{115291}Orlando, you like it?
{115294}{115354}It's autumn sunrise.
{115414}{115498}Get out of me,|you son of a bitch.
{115573}{115635}Don't you ever do that|to me again.
{115641}{115668}Orlando?
{115671}{115703}Ugh!
{115706}{115765}I can barely move.
{115768}{115811}You should know|better than that.
{115814}{115862}Jumping into bodies|wipes you out.
{115866}{115887}Everybody out.
{115890}{115921}What happened|to Orlando?
{115923}{115984}Where's|the insurance policy?
{115986}{116018}Are you deaf?
{116021}{116078}I said everybody out!
{116080}{116108}Everybody out!
{116110}{116146}Get out! Get out!
{116149}{116181}Everybody get out!
{116466}{116506}Get out.
{116509}{116539}You the fortune-teller?
{116542}{116578}Who are you?
{116581}{116612}That's an interesting|question.
{116641}{116681}Why don't you tell me?
{116683}{116708}Willy.
{116710}{116744}Willy?
{116746}{116785}Prospect Place Willy?
{116787}{116833}Get out of here fast.
{117118}{117169}Oda Mae!|Sister! Sister!
{117211}{117267}I'm all right.|I'm all right.
{117325}{117382}We're in trouble,|so you got to help.
{117384}{117454}What do you mean we?|You're already dead.
{117456}{117514}These people|are trying to kill me.
{117516}{117548}And they'll be back.
{117550}{117620}Why don't you just find|a house to haunt?
{117622}{117681}Get some chains and|rattle them or something.
{117684}{117736}I have a plan,|and it will work,
{117738}{117782}but get some|of your fake I.D.s.
{117785}{117814}Forget it.
{117817}{117899}If you do this, they'll|never bother you again.
{118019}{118045}Scout's honor.
{118078}{118113}All right.
{118117}{118154}What do I have to do?
{118161}{118207}What exactly|do I have to do?
{118249}{118295}You got a nice dress?
{118354}{118431}I don't see what's wrong|with what I'm wearing.
{118433}{118513}Sorry. I made a joke.|I love your shoes.
{118515}{118575}I don't know anything|about banking.
{118577}{118633}Oda Mae, would|you just relax?
{118636}{118672}Listen, I'm nervous.
{118674}{118720}I'll get you|through it.
{118722}{118778}Your fake driver's|license is great.
{118785}{118864}Oh, Sam. I don't think|I should do this.
{118867}{118938}Straight ahead.|A stairway that says new accounts.
{118940}{118986}I ain't giving|them money.
{118988}{119034}Do what I say.|Don't talk.

{119633}{119664}when you opened|the account?
{119667}{119727}Carl Bruner opened it|for you by phone
{119730}{119775}and asked you|to come in today.
{119778}{119844}Carl Bruner opened it|for me by phone.

{120388}{120444}I'm so sorry.
{120446}{120478}You know, I...
{120481}{120549}I need another one.|I signed the wrong name.
{120667}{120746}Make sure it goes up to|the third floor file
{120748}{120808}because you have|a transaction to make.
{120810}{120877}Make sure this goes|to the third floor file.
{120879}{120936}I have a transfusion|to make.
{120938}{120959}A what?
{120962}{120998}Let's go.
{121001}{121079}You know what I mean.|Can I keep this pen?
{121082}{121129}Uh...uh,|yes, sure.
{121136}{121173}Thank you so much.
{121199}{121269}Bye-bye. I just|love these pens.
