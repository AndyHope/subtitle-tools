# Text Encoding
Most of the work when identifying text encodings is done by [uchardet](https://github.com/BYVoid/uchardet), in some cases additional guesswork is required.

## Supported encodings

## Not confident
I am not confident about the following encodings:
- **euc-jp** (example file looks kind of weird)
- **ISO-8859-5** (only example is a ".nfo" file)
- **KOI8-R** (only example is not a text file, consists mostly of NULL bytes)
- **windows-1253** (only example is a binary file)
- **EUC-TW** (only example seems like gibberish)
- **HZ** (one weird example file)
