14
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,760
宝贝
Baby.

15
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,490
我爱你
I love you.

16
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,950
是吗  我也爱你
Hell, yeah, you do. Love you, too, girl.

17
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,160
-真的吗  -当然
- Do you really? - Yeah.

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,520
-认真的吗  -你怎么老问我这个
- I mean, are you sure? - Why you always ask me that?

19
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,890
我爱你  不管你问多少遍
You ask me that a lot. I do.

20
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:39,810
有多爱
How much?

21
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,050
这种事情怎么能量化呢
Got to quantify every damn thing, huh, baby?

22
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,900
我只是想听你说出来
Maybe I just like to hear you say it.

23
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,760
-那我就再说一遍  -好
- Maybe I'll just say it again. - Okay.

24
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,700
我爱你
I love you.

25
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,760
过来
Bring it in here.

26
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,500
胜过世间一切
More than anything, baby.

27
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,510
胜过橄榄球吗
More than football?

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,040
当然胜过橄榄球
More than ball. Come on, now.

29
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,740
那和年度最佳新秀奖杯比呢
More than your Rookie of the Year trophy?

30
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,840
-奖杯算个屁  -好吧
- Fuck that trophy. - All right.

31
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,790
超级碗冠军戒指呢
How about that Super Bowl ring?

32
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,080
这就是个装饰而已
It's just jewelry, baby.

33
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,660
所以你愿意为我做任何事吗
So you would do anything for me?

34
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:07,530
因为你知道我愿意为你做任何事
'Cause, baby, you know I'd do anything for you.

35
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,450
哪怕是舍弃我的性命
Even kill myself.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,930
没错  任何事  宝贝
Yup, absolutely anything, baby.

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,710
包括离开你妻子吗
Even leave your wife?

38
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,850
-你这个骗子  我就知道  -冷静点
- You motherfucker. I knew it. - Hey, relax.

39
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,900
你跟我说你们分居了
You told me you were separated.

40
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,110
别抱怨这么多  根本没必要
Well, stop labeling every damn thing because you don't have to.

41
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,180
你这个骗子  我调查过了
You lying piece of shit. I checked.

42
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,700
别吵了
Come on.

43
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,590
你冷静的
Come on! Hey!

44
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,860
你疯了吗
Fuck! Ah! Oh, shit!

45
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,690
我很清楚的一点是
The one thing I do know is that

46
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,750
他爱的家庭胜过一切
he loved his family more than anything.

47
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,330
缇娜  你就是他的一切
Tina, you meant the world to him.

48
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,840
还记得我的第一场比赛是打防守端锋
I remember my first game starting at defensive end.

49
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,210
那是在...
It was--

50
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,960
在旧的巨人体育场
it was at the old Giants Stadium

51
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,660
当时风很大  我们落后三分
and the wind was blowing and we were down by a field goal.

52
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,130
我判断出一个掩护传球  但又把球弄丢了
I read a screen pass and I dropped

53
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,530
本该是一次扭转胜局的抢断
a game-winning interception.

54
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,390
当时罗德用黑武士一样的眼神瞪着我
And I could feel Rod's Darth Vader stare.

55
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,730
他说  “你要是再出现这种失误
He looked at me, he said, "You do that again,

56
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,410
就可以去杂货店上班了”
you'll be bagging groceries."

57
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,950
接下来的一个回合  他完成抄截
The very next play, he jumped the route,

58
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,150
达阵得分
took it right to the house.

59
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,470
彻底拯救了我
Saved my ass that day.

60
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,360
真他妈完蛋
How fucked up was that?

61
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,490
最完蛋的应该是
Man, you know what was fucked up

62
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,110
第一排那女人吧
was that shorty in the front row.

63
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,360
-你看见了吗  -看见什么
- You saw that? - Seen what?

64
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,530
当然看见了  她真是变态
Hell, yeah. She was a straight up freak.

65
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,790
我怎么总错过这些事
Why do I always miss the freaks?

66
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,050
罗德也会喜欢的  对吧
Rod would have loved that, huh?

67
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,690
老天爷的想法真是猜不透
God works in mysterious ways.

68
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,780
我们不如今晚出去玩玩  纪念一下我兄弟
What do you say we honor my man's life by going out tonight?

69
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:46,770
去哪一家店
What are you thinking?

70
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,130
"故事"  那里罗德最喜欢
Story? It was Rod's favorite spot.

71
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,120
-有我的份吗  -"有我的份吗"
- Am I invited? - "Am I invited?"

72
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,320
我可不想不请自来
I didn't want to be assumptious.

73
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,860
-真是服了  -回见
- Listen to this. - I'll see y'all later.

74
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,060
要叫上些葬礼上的妹子吗
So should I grab some of these funeral hos?

75
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,600
看好了  看好了
Watch me work. Watch me work.

76
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,750
你们好
Hello, hello.

77
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,750
很抱歉  我完全理解
I'm sorry. I completely understand.

78
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,710
你根本不理解  你知不知道他连遗嘱都没留
No, you really don't. Do you know he didn't leave a will?

79
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,920
人寿保险也没有
No life insurance either.

80
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,400
就是那个我行我素的罗德尼
Just Roddney being Roddney.

81
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,860
我已经开始想他了  但是
I miss the man already, but...

82
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,760
你知道那个贱人小金多久了
how long you know about that bitch Kim?

83
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,190
不怎么认识  我没和他们一起出去过
I didn't know her much. I never hung out with them.

84
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,360
别骗我了  斯宾塞
Oh, stop with the lies, Spence.

85
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,440
好吧  还有什么我能帮忙的地方吗
Okay, at least tell me how I can help.

86
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,160
你先操心你自己吧
Start by helping yourself.

87
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,930
-我吗  -是的
- Myself? - Yeah.

88
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,900
罗德退役之后  他不知道自己到底是谁了
After Rod stopped playing, he had no idea who he was.

89
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,720
身份认同障碍
Identity issues.

90
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,800
你是个成年人
Look, you a grown-ass man.

91
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,070
处理好你自己的事吧
So go out there and figure your shit out.

92
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,930
我处理得很好
I got a handle on that.

93
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,810
你真这么觉得吗
Is that what you tell yourself?

94
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,780
我很好啊
I'm good.

95
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,020
大红人  你今天到哪去了
Big Time. Where the hell were you today?

96
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,650
-什么  -你知道罗德去世了吗
- Huh? - Did you hear about Rod?

97
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,830
是  我知道
Oh, yeah, yeah, that.

98
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,990
很抱歉我没能去现场
Right, man, I'm sorry I couldn't make that, man.

99
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,930
我有困难了  需要点钱周转
I'm in a spot. I need some gap cash short term.

100
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,530
交房租之类的  你懂的
You know, for rent and things.

101
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,320
你在开玩笑吗
How the fuck is that even possible?

102
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,230
我有个大家庭  你知道的
You know how it is, I got a big family,

103
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,100
还有很多朋友  他们都要吃饭
lot of friends, too. They need to eat.

104
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,290
好吧  你需要多少
All right, how much you need?

105
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,720
三十万就好
Just 300 grand.

106
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,490
你开什么玩笑
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

107
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:47,230
三十万美元
$300,000?

108
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,430
你选秀完可是签了一千两百万的合同  维农
You signed for 12 mil out of school, Vernon.

109
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,710
你懂的  兄弟
You know how it is, man.

110
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,620
只花掉新秀年那部分  把剩下的存起来
You spend the rookie deal, save the next.

111
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,610
你赶紧跟我说实话
You telling me the whole story right now?

112
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,420
你知道我愿意为你做任何事
You know I'd do anything for you, right?

113
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,620
但你要说实话  到底发生了什么
But you've got to be straight up with me. I need the whole story.

114
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,170
我再联系你
Man, I'm gonna call you back.

115
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,290
我再联系你
I'm gonna call you back.

116
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,870
维农  维农
Vernon. Vernon.

117
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,170
斯宾塞  好哥们  快过来
Spencer. Mi amigo. Andale.

118
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,030
天啊  这葬礼不错啊
Man, that was some funeral, huh?

119
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,330
真希望我死的时候也能有这么多人
Hope that many people show up when I die.

120
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:19,480
上千人出现追悼斯莱特

121
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,620
还有不少热门球员呢
Some hot snatch there, too.

122
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,830
你有没有拉几个回来
Did you get any leads?

123
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,460
乔  那他妈的可是葬礼
Joe, it was a fucking funeral.

124
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,700
别"擒抱"信使啊  干嘛不拉
All right, tackle the messenger, why don't you?

125
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,070
我在葬礼上可签过不少大单
I'm just saying. I've done some of my best work at funerals.

126
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,120
想知道为什么吗  因为人们都在胡思乱想
You want to know why? Because people are thinking.

127
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,370
他们在质疑自己曾经做过的事情
People are thinking I could have done stuff differently.

128
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,910
多希望我了解我的母亲
I wish I'd known my mother.

129
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:39,190
多希望我可以把祖母照顾得再好一点
I wish I'd taken care of my grandmother better.

130
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,370
多希望我有个财务经理
I wish I had a financial manager

131
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,940
来管理我的财务  等等等等
to manage my finances. Stuff like that.

132
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,300
-尊重一下死人吧  -对不起  你说得对
- Come on, show some respect. - I'm sorry, you're right.

133
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,050
只是上面的人给我的压力太大了
It's just that I'm getting a lot of pressure from upstairs.

134
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,660
我说的可不是上帝
You know, and I don't mean God.

135
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,450
他们觉得我雇你
They think I hired you

136
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,170
因为你在我梦幻橄榄球队里
because you were on my Fantasy team.

137
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:55,960
你不过是防守组球员好吗
You played defense for crying out loud.

138
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,890
难道要我玩一对一防守联盟吗  废柴才玩
I'm gonna play in an IDP league? That's for suckers.

139
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,090
听着  总有一天
Look, there's gonna come a time,

140
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,270
你已经来这里一年了  你将不得不...
because you've been here a year now, where you're gonna have to--

141
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,060
把友谊金钱化  你是想说这个吧
Monetize my friendships, right?

142
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,630
没错  但让你一说
Yeah, but the way you say it, you know,

143
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,690
"把友谊金钱化"
"Monetize my friendships,"

144
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,430
感觉我是个大混蛋
it makes me sound like an asshole.

145
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,970
可我不是  你知道的
And I'm not. You know me.

146
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,090
我雇你是为了人脉
I hired you for access.

147
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,990
为了你的那些朋友  那些球员
For your friends. For players.

148
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,360
甚至是那些你恨的人  我才不在乎
Even the ones you hate. I don't care.

149
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,780
我不在乎是谁
I don't care who it is.

150
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,890
也不在乎他们为谁效力
I don't care who they played for.

克伦肖的胖雷基在帮他打理财务
Fat Reggie from Crenshaw handles his money?

299
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,390
是啊  以为一起打过青年联赛就能让他成为理财专家了
Yeah. Thinks playing Pop Warner together makes him E.F. Hutton.

300
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,830
该死  你怎么能让他这么做
God damn. How could you let that happen?

301
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:58,460
我能怎么办  你不是也没能阻止他
What, like I had a choice? How did you let that happen?

302
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,080
我在试着帮他找别人
I'm trying to get him a new deal.

303
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,300
该让我来帮他理财
I should be handling his money.

304
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,020
你为什么不这么做呢
Why aren't you handling his money?

305
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:09,180
我知道怎么一回事了  那个带着理财经理的老家伙
I know what this is about. That old thing with the money manager.

306
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,360
他给你多少
What'd he get you for?

307
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,760
八十万
800 grand.

308
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,120
听着  我们都被骗过
Look, we all get burned.

309
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,250
别让维农重蹈我们的覆辙
Don't let Vernon learn the hard way, all right?

310
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,940
他需要你  如果你不签下他  他也会找别人的
He needs you. And if you don't sign him, somebody else will.

311
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,170
你说得对  我借他三十万
You're right. I'm gonna loan him 300K

312
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,590
然后签下他成为客户
and sign him as a client.

313
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,450
你疯了  斯宾塞  我知道你没那么多钱
You're crazy. Spencer, I know you don't got that kind of money.

314
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,940
那也比不上你
No crazier than you loaning

315
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,610
身无分文还借了你第一个客户五万
your first client 50K when you had zero.

316
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,790
最后不挺好吗
Things turned out okay for you.

317
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,470
没错  但你完全没风险
Yeah, but you were a sure thing.

318
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,300
不  才不是
No, I wasn't.

319
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,290
我差远了
Not even close.

320
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,700
哥们  我在今早踩椭圆机时
Bro, bro, I'm on the elliptical this morning

321
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,540
看了眼《体育中心》
watching "SportsCenter."

322
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,510
你哥们里基出什么事了  可卡因吗
What's up with your boy Ricky? What is it, cocaine?

323
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,130
你可得给我第一手资料
You've got to give me the real scoop.

324
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,770
里基  怎么了  哥们
Ricky, what's going on, brother?

325
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,970
-能谈谈吗  -当然
- You wanted to talk? - Yeah.

326
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:51,540
今晚在顶尖112餐厅一起吃饭吧
Let's have dinner tonight at Prime 112.

327
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,980
不行  不能这样
No, no, no, can't do that. Can't do that.

328
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:55,370
我不想见人而且这事很急  斯宾塞  求你了
I don't want to see nobody and this cannot wait, Spence. Come on.

329
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,000
-你在哪  -你觉得我还能在哪
- Where you at? - Where else you think I am?

330
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,400
我他妈就在你办公室外面  快来  哥们
I'm right outside your fucking office. Come on, man, let's go.

331
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,110
等等  给我一分钟
Hold on one second. Just give me a minute.

332
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:09,220
行行行  但听我说
Yeah, yeah, yeah. But, hey, listen to me. Listen to me.

333
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,850
你该签了他  知道吗
You should be handling him, okay?

334
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,230
下手的最好时机是在对方最脆弱的时候
The time to pounce is when people are at their weakest.

335
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,910
他很脆弱  你发现了吗  很明显
He's weak. You smell that? Blood in the water.

336
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,270
-你听见我说话没  -知道了
- You hear me? - Got it.

337
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,060
好  你好  里基
Okay. What's up, Ricky?

338
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,770
-我打的静音  -好吧
- It's on mute. - Oh, okay.

339
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,590
帮我跟他问个好  好吗
Just tell him I said, "What's up?" Okay?

340
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,370
好  快点  快点
Okay, go, go, go, go.

341
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,390
好了  哥们  出发吧
All right, brother. Let's roll.

342
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:29,720
别带上办公室里那个操蛋的乡下人
Hey, leave that corny motherfucker in the office, man.

343
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,400
-我不想被交易  -你之前被交易过
- I don't want to be traded. - You've been traded before.

344
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,610
是  我那时候年少无知
Yeah, I was young and stupid then.

345
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:43,930
-那时吗  -对  现在不同了  哥们
- Then? - Yeah, then. This time it's different, man.

346
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,490
我喜欢目前的状态
I like where I am.

347
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,300
不想玩那套试着了解别人的把戏
Don't want to play the get-to-know-you game.

348
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,780
学习全新的战术手册
Learn a new playbook.

349
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,410
靠  他们想把我送去不景气的杰克森威尔
Shit, I mean, they want to send me to sorry-ass Jacksonville

350
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,840
我事业就完了  然后我退役
where careers go to die, then I'll retire.

351
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,390
我再做其他的事情  我不在乎
I'll do something else.  I do not care.

352
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,520
你在拿退役威胁我吗
Are you threatening to quit?

353
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:58,010
斯宾塞  我去年接了八十个球  八十个
Spence, I had 80 catches last year, baby. I had 80.

354
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,600
所以你会早点退役吗
So you're gonna retire early?

355
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,050
像提基·巴伯一样
Pull a Tiki Barber

356
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,910
橄榄球退役后追寻自己的梦想  是吗
and pursue your dreams after football, huh?

357
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,440
靠  你觉得你会有什么特殊优待吗
Shit. You think there should be special rules?

358
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,760
里基最大吗
Ricky rules?

359
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,800
当然不是  我不是这个意思
Hell, no. I'm not saying that.

360
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,490
但是  你怎么会理解呢
But, you know, how could you know?

361
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,300
他们可没这样对你
They didn't treat you like this.

362
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,010
金童
Golden boy.

363
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,290
金童吗
Golden boy, huh?

364
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,830
我来跟你讲讲  金童过气之后会咋样吧
Let me tell you how it went down for the golden boy.

365
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,270
之前我以为我退役那天是
I had this vision of my retirement day

366
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,530
站在颁奖台上  面前摆着话筒
standing up at the podium, microphone in front of me.

367
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,240
教练站在一边  经理站在另一边
Coach on one side, owner on the other,

368
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,360
家人和朋友簇拥着我
family and friends around.

369
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,670
你知道真实情况是什么样的吗
You know how it really went down?

370
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,470
他妈的傻坐在客厅里
Sitting up in my goddamn living room

371
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,350
盯着手机
just staring at my cell phone

372
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,890
等着那个电话  经理的电话
waiting for that call to come in. From the GM, the owner.

373
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,450
教练本该给我打电话的
I would have taken a call from the fucking trainer.

374
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,210
谢谢你  斯宾塞  我们很感激  斯宾塞
Thank you, Spence. Appreciate it, Spence.

375
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,700
祝好运  斯宾塞
Good luck, Spence.

376
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,040
你知道他们什么时候打的电话吗
You know when that call finally came?

377
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,530
从没打过
Never.

378
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,440
真的吗
For real?

379
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,730
你最好搞明白这些破事
You better wise the fuck up.

380
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,350
因为你还有一个合约在  结束了以后
'Cause you got one contract left and when it's done,

381
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:12,150
你就会像我们一样  流落街头
you'll be out here in the streets with the rest of us.

382
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,140
你要是一直再做这种傻逼事
You keep fucking up like this,

383
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,100
一直再像个黄毛小子一样
you keep acting like a little kid,

384
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:18,600
合约结束  你就完了
when it's done and you're done,

385
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,860
你会破产  颠沛流离
you're gonna be broke and miserable.

386
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,120
你知道最糟糕的是什么吗
And you know what the worst part about it is?

387
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,420
没人他妈的在乎你
Nobody will give a fuck about you.

388
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,790
这都是我亲身经历
I've been there.

389
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,600
你需要成长起来
You need to grow up.

390
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,620
你要开始表现得
You need to start acting

391
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,410
像个专业选手一样
and conducting yourself like a professional.

392
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:39,510
看着我  别他妈再我行我素了
Look at me. No more doing shit on your own.

393
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,830
别乱打电话  暗地里私会
No more phone calls. No more meetings.

394
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,920
别再去夜店  别再在洗手间跟女的乱搞
No more nightclubs. No more fucking girls in the bathroom.

395
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,340
还有  别他妈瞎发推
And no more fucking Twitter.

396
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,500
去他妈的推特  哥们
Fuck Twitter, man.

397
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,290
雪佛兰

398
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,900
嗨  今天还好吗  哥们
Hey, hey, how you doing today, buddy?

399
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,790
好  好  你呢
Good. Good. How about you?

400
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,920
我很好  您是想换新车吗
I'm doing great. You looking for an upgrade?

401
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,790
不
Oh, no.

402
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,180
我是想找一份工作
I'm actually looking to get me a job.

403
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,020
你之前有从事过汽车销售吗
You ever worked in car sales before?

404
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,950
没有  先生
No, sir.

405
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:11,160
-销售其他的呢  -没有  先生
- Sales of any kind? - No, sir.

406
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,300
您的上一份工作是什么
What was your last job?

407
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:14,680
你是橄榄球粉丝吗
You a football fan?

408
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,540
拜托  我必须的是啊
Come on. Hell, yeah, I'm a fan.

409
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,520
我为海盗队打过进攻线
Played offensive line for the Bucs.

410
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,040
-查尔斯·格林  -别逗了
- Charles Greane. - No shit.

411
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,590
-真的  -我不记得你
- Yeah. - I don't remember you.

412
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,990
你好
Hello.

413
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,010
约翰逊先生  我是里基·杰瑞特
Mr. Johnson, Ricky Jarret.

414
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,980
我打电话是想道歉  好吗
I'm calling to apologize, all right?

415
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,100
是我搞砸了  好吗
Um, I messed up, all right?

416
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,840
的确就是这样  我搞砸了  我很操蛋
No other way to say it. I messed up. I'm a fuckup.

417
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,700
我当时情绪激动  失去理智了
I let my emotions get the best of me.

418
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,710
谢谢你这么诚实  孩子
I appreciate your honesty, son.

419
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,710
不过我还想说  还想说以后我
Also want to add, though-- I want to add that I will never,

420
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:46,810
绝不会再给自己或者你的团队惹这种事了
ever put myself or your team in this position again.

421
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,130
很高兴听你这么说
It's good to hear.

422
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,210
也很感谢你的来电
And I admire the call.

423
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,150
我会把这些都考虑进去的
I'll take it all under consideration.

424
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,310
-谢谢您  先生  -保重
- Thank you, sir. - You take care.

425
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,500
解雇他
Cut him.

426
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,040
解雇我  解雇里基·杰瑞特
Cut me? Cut Ricky Jarret?

427
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,850
我在接球手榜上可是第二十二名
22nd all time on the receivers list.

428
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,810
-紧跟在史蒂夫·拉根特后  -那他妈是谁
- Behind Steve Largent. - Who the fuck is that?

429
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:08,900
他是名人堂里的  里基
He's in the Hall of Fame, Rick.

430
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,160
你怎么可以不知道史蒂夫·拉根特是谁
How do you not know who Steve Largent is?

431
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,110
真不敢相信他们这样对我  靠
Can't believe they got me in this position, man.

432
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,180
我能理解  因为公共关系课上学到的
I can. Because the first thing they teach us in PR

433
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,300
第一件事就是别被人抓住在洗手间乱搞
is to not get caught fucking skanks in the bathroom.

434
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,640
男人能做出更操蛋的事来呢
Men have done much worse.

435
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,390
你特么还是闭上嘴吧
You know what? Just shut the fuck up.

436
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:20,540
他们把我贬的一文不值
They got no value for me out there.

437
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,890
你现在该明白是怎么回事了
Well, look, you know how it is now.

438
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:22,980
一旦他们抓到你的把柄
Once they see an imperfection,

439
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,000
就立刻跟你撇清关系
the organization wants nothing to do with you.

440
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,140
这就是政治啊  里基
Politics, Rick.

441

宝贝儿  冷静点  好吗
Baby, chill, all right.

451
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,760
听着  我不能这样干等
Look, I can't stand the wait.

452
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,610
我是西费特
This is Siefert.

453

你是不是想找人帮你打边线
You looking for a guy who could set the edge for you?

454
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,680
一直在找  但就是找不到人替代斯特拉斯莫
Always. Never been able to replace this guy Strasmore.

455
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,400
他原来是帮我们拦截四分卫的
Used to get after the QB for us.

456
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,120
我听说你很关心
I heard you're concentrating

457
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,890
这几天橄榄球事件的当事人啊
on the other side of the ball these days.

458
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,010
-你是想谈杰瑞特的事的吗  -是的
- You calling about Jarret? - Yes, I am.

459
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,950
你什么时候成了注册经纪人了
When did you become a registered agent?

460
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,980
我不是什么经纪人
Not an agent.

461
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,720
不过是个朋友而已
Just a friend.

462
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,860
-我刚才还担心呢  -担心什么
- I was worried. - Why?

463
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,130
我进来时  你没躺在沙发上看《体育中心》
I came in, "Sports Center" wasn't on. You weren't on the couch.

464
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,770
我还以为你被绑架了呢
I thought somebody abducted you.

465
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,620
亲爱的  总拿我开涮有意思吗
Baby, why you always got to make jokes at my expense?

466
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,920
你知道我很敏感的
You know I'm sensitive.

467
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,840
因为我知道你内心深处是喜欢这样的
'Cause deep down, I know you like it.

我其实真的不喜欢这样
I really don't, though.

469
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,980
遇到严苛的教练时  你总会表现得更好
You always played better for a hard-ass coach.

470
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,770
这话不假  但是...
True, but...

471
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,700
你知道的  老娘永远支持你
You know Mama is always here for you.

472
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:34,150
世上任何事都不能与你相比  我挺你
More than anything in this world, I've got your back.

473
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,110
咱俩可是一条船上的蚂蚱
We in this shit together.

474
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,330
今天工作找得怎么样
So, how'd it go today?

475
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,250
-有靠谱的吗  -老天
- Any leads? - Oh, man.

476
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,710
现在这世道对你宝贝来说有点小艰难  但是
Little rough out there for your boy today, baby, but,

477
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,980
现在你眼前的正是迈阿密最大的
you're now looking at the newest salesman

478
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,960
雪佛兰经销店新上任的销售员

479
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,780
我真为你骄傲  你成功了
I'm so proud of you. You did it.

480
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,840
都是为了你
All for you.

481
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,420
我来给你跳一支雪佛兰脱衣舞

Give it to me.

485
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,000
对于绿湾队来说  今天可真是祸不单行
And even more bad news coming out of Green Bay

486
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,450
该队的外接手里基·杰瑞特又惹祸了

487
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,270
这位八年资历的老将已被包装工队开除
The eight-year veteran has just been released by the Packers.

488
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,270
现在他得去找份新...
Now he's got to search for a new--

489
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,040
仁慈的主
Dear God...

490
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:41,390
如果你能赐予我一个重回联盟打球的机会
if You bestow upon me a chance to play ball in this league again,

491
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,450
一个系紧鞋带
a chance to lace up my shoes,

492
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,570
重新戴上头盔的机会
a chance to put on that helmet

493
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:50,170
能让我再次在球场上打败那些混蛋
and once again ball-- ball on these motherfuckers,

494
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,420
我愿将一切荣耀献给您
I'll give You all the glory.

495
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,630
我现在懂了
I get it now.

496
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,180
我不会让您失望的
I'll do You proud.

497
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,920
阿门
Amen.

498
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,550
紧咬保修期  保险这些卖点
Try to sell on warranty, try to sell on the gap--

499
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,160
要是顾客问的我不知道该怎么办
And what I do if I don't know something?

500
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:12,070
你可是汽车销售员  查尔斯  随便编

那就好  您是想来升级您的车吗

504

不不  我想找辆能在礁岛群钓鱼的卡车

505
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,940
钓鱼啊  我从小就钓鱼
Oh, fishing. I grew up fishing.

506
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,180
小时候我爸教我的  现在我偶尔也去钓
My daddy taught me early. Yeah, I still do some.

507
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,150
在哪儿钓  回比洛克西吗
Where, back in Biloxi?

508
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,620
你怎么知道我是密西西比人
How you know I'm from Mississippi?

509
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,830
-你不是查尔斯·格林吗  -是的  先生

511
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,680
你可是我从大学发掘的呢
I scouted you when I was at the U.

512
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,380
还是没法相信我们输给了中佛罗里达大学
Still can't believe we lost out to Central Florida.

513
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:43,920
中佛大那时候可没这么多帮派
Hey, UCF had a lot less folks back then.

514
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,980
我那时候也没现在这么潮
Wasn't always a city slicker like I am now.

515
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,390
这是新款  对吧
This is the new model, right?

516
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:50,250
是的  是的  今年最新款
Yeah, yeah, brand-new for this year.

517
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,880
有什么可以升级的
What are some of the upgrades?

518
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
可以升级力矩
Uh, a lot of torque.

519
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,320
转矩马力更大  马力可以
It's got new torque power. The horsepower--

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,620
-马力有多大  -大约625
- What's the horsepower? - It's got about 625.

521
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,400
你是和里基·杰瑞特一起打球的  对吧
You played with Ricky Jarret, right?

522
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,650
是的  大约三个赛季吧
Yeah, yeah. About three seasons.

523
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:04,050
就在我们赢得了超级碗之后
Right after we won the Super Bowl.

524
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,710
他挺有个性啊
He sure is some character.

525
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,590
是啊  里基还是挺有意思的
Yeah, that Ricky is always entertaining.

526
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,610
他真的那么混球 吗
Is he as much of an ass as he appears?

527
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:14,020
不  他只是比较有激情  里基只在乎赢球
No, he's just passionate. All Ricky cares about is winning.

528
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,460
如果真有什么事  应该也是个误会
If anything, he's just a little misunderstood.

529
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,110
-我们不都如此吗  -大概是吧
- Aren't we all? - I guess so.

530
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,130
先生  您真的是来买这辆雪佛兰的吗
Hey, mister, you really here about this Chevy,

531
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,230
还是来调查里基的
or you came to kick the tires on Ricky?

532
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,100
人们总是误把乡里人当成蠢货
People often mistake country with dumb.

533
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,050
这些人通常是城里人
Those people are usually from the city.

534
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,470
这话有理
Good point.

535
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,530
这个  这个好
So this-- the great--

536
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,120
那人看起来是个大顾客  伙计
That guy looked like a buyer, man.

537
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,440
你拿到他的手机号  联系方式什么的了吗
Did you get his phone number, contact, anything?

538
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,710
无所谓啦  伙计  他才不会买呢
Oh, man, it don't matter. He ain't buying nothing.

539
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,470
怎么  你是手握水晶球吗
Fuck, you got a crystal ball now?

540
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,120
你是能预见未来还是怎么的
You can see the future?

541
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,640
我向上帝祈祷了  他回应了我的祈求
I prayed to God and He answered my call.

542
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,220
你知道上帝比较难以捉摸吧
You know the Lord works in mysterious ways.

543
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,670
我也知道是我和你的超级经纪人
I also know that it was me and your super agent

544
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,320
帮你得到这次去迈阿密队的机会的
who got you that in-person with Miami.

545
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,420
那都是上帝雄伟蓝图的一部分  不是吗
It's all part of God's plan, ain't it?

546
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,380
-咱还是聊聊咱的计划吧  -好
- Let's talk about our plan. - Let's.

547
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,650
我们需要你好好悔悟
Need you to be contrite.

548
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,980
让他知道你从过去的经历中吸取了教训
Let him know you learned from the experience.

549
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,170
-没错  谦逊点  -那种事情不许再发生
- Yes, be humble. - Also that it won't happen again.

550
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,480
-好  -以后教练和团队让你做什么
- Never. - And that you're gonna do anything

551
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,680
-你就做什么  -当然
- the coach and team needs you to do. - Absolutely.

552
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,460
-就算是让你去特勤组  -当然不
- Even play special teams. - Absolutely not.

553
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,040
-我才不要  -里基
- I'm not doing that. - Rick.

554
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,800
让我去特勤组我也去
I'll even play special teams.

555
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,640
很好  走吧  可别迟到
Good, now get going. You don't want to be late, okay?

556
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,510
他是个很守时的人
He's a stickler for punctuality.

557
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,070
我不会迟到的
I won't be late, yo.

558
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,540
我知道我喜欢惹麻烦
And I know I'm not the easiest person to deal with.

559
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,920
很感谢你们这时候没有抛弃我
So I appreciate y'all don't bail on me when shit goes down.

560
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,590
就没想过要放弃你  走吧
Never crossed our minds. Let's go.

561
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,920
我是热情冲动的人  天性就是这样
I'm a passionate man. It's all coming from a spiritual place.

562
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,050
这句话记得别说
That right there, don't say that.

563
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,900
去吧
Get it.

564
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,470
他肯定要搞砸
He's gonna fuck this up.

565
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,150
-嗯  大约六成的可能性吧  -一定行
- Yeah, about a 60% chance. - Got this!

566
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,710
-教练  -尚克  给我瓶啤酒

-迟到了  -很好  这样就清楚了

00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,510
你就是个混蛋
You are an asshole.

575
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,280
走错路了  小子  走错了
Bad life choices, son. Bad life choices.

576
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,410
教练
Coach!

577
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,910
好哥们  来抱一个
My man! Come deliver that green hug.

578
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,610
